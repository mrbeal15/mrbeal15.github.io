      As strange as it may seem, sometimes asking the question is harder than figuring out the solution. Especially when it comes to coding. Google has been my best friend since I started Phase 0, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Whenever I get stuck or need a little more clarification, I prefer Google over message boards. Mainly because I am impatient, especially when I am struggling with something. Also because more times than not, someone has ran into the same problem that I am facing, and someone else has already solved said problem. I think if there was a hot-line that I could call with questions and get an immediate answer, that might replace Google, but unfortunately, to my knowledge, it doesn't exist. Not that there is anything wrong with posting to the plus community or stack overflow, I guess I've just been lucky thus far that I haven't needed to.

      When it comes to asking questions, or in my case Googling, I try to be specific enough that I don't have to sift through a lot of irrelevant articles and posts, while at the same time not being so specific that my search returns nothing. In one of the articles I read for this blog post, it said to make the title interesting so that people don't overlook your post, which is true. I've found that the shorter the question is, without sacrificing the details, the more likely people are to respond. I, myself, even tend to skip over long, drawn out posts regardless of whether what I was looking for was in it or not. I think it comes down to putting just you need to know. No more and no less. Clarification, for me at least comes from reading and research, but errors can be resolved by asking the right questions, the right way.
